    <p>The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is 22 miles (35 km) southwest of downtown Boston.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots, the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) before joining the NFL in 1970 through the AFLâ€“NFL merger. The Patriots played their home games at various stadiums throughout Boston until the franchise moved to Foxborough in 1971. The team changed its name from the original Boston Patriots after relocating to Foxborough, although Foxborough is a suburb of Boston, and is located halfway between Boston and Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
    <p>The New England Patriots are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and also have the most Super Bowl appearances overall at eleven.</p>
